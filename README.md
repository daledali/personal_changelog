# The Scott Bromander Change Log

### Overview
This is a personal changelog of my updates. Not everything is code. I wanted to create visability around the behaviors and habits for my students. Additionally, as covered in my first large writing project, **Furious Growth**, this is a means to hold myself accountable to growth each day.

Note that this log is starting as of August 21st, 2019 and it not a full description of what I have read and courses I have taken. 

Highlights of past reading and courses can be found here! (Eventually)
